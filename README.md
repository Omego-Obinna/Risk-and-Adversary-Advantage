# Monte Carlo Simulations for Adversary's Advantage and Risk Assessment üìöüíª

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB simulation codes designed to evaluate the adversary‚Äôs advantage $(\mathsf{Adv})$ and associated risk $(R)$ in strategic scenarios between an adversary $(\mathcal{A})$ and a user $(\mathcal{U})$. The simulations explore:

- **Positive Advantage Scenario:** $\mathsf{Adv} > 0$ indicating increased risk to the user.
- **Negative Advantage Scenario:** $\mathsf{Adv} < 0$ indicating reduced or even negative risk to the user.

These Monte Carlo simulations generate results that can be visualized in 3D scatter plots and histograms, providing valuable insights into how changes in parameters influence $(\mathsf{Adv})$ and $(R)$.

## Description üìù

**What the Code Does:**
- Implements Monte Carlo simulations by sampling key parameters from specified probability distributions.
- Calculates the adversary‚Äôs advantage and risk based on sampled parameters.
- Produces 3D visualizations of the relationships between the probability of attacking $( p^* )$, the probability of hiding $( q^* )$, and the resulting risk.
- Outputs statistical summaries (mean, min, max) of $(\mathsf{Adv})$ and $(R)$.

**Scenarios:**
1. **Positive Advantage:** 
   - Higher benefit for the adversary under certain conditions.
   - Visualizes how user risk can escalate.

2. **Negative Advantage:**
   - Configurations where adversary‚Äôs success probabilities are lower when the user hides.
   - Demonstrates how the user might achieve scenarios where the risk is minimized or even negative.

## Features üåü

- **Parameter Sampling:** Randomly sample from uniform and Beta distributions.
- **Probability Constraints:** Ensure $( p^* )$ and $( q^* )$ remain within [0,1].
- **Dynamic Impact Factors:** Compute risk using flexible cost-benefit parameters.
- **Visual Outputs:** Interactive 3D plots and histograms for deeper analysis.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Mean, minimum, and maximum values for both $(\mathsf{Adv})$ and $(R)$.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or newer recommended).

### Steps to Run
1. **Setup:** Download or clone this repository.
2. **Unzip Files:** Extract `simulation_code.zip` into your MATLAB working directory.
3. **Open MATLAB:** Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
4. **Run:** Execute `positive_advantage_simulation.m` or `negative_advantage_simulation.m` from the MATLAB command window or editor.
5. **View Results:** 
   - Examine the 3D scatter plots and histograms in MATLAB figure windows.
   - Review the printed statistics in the command window.

### Customization üîß
- Modify parameter ranges (e.g., `B_A_leak_range`, `C_U_hide_range`).
- Adjust Beta distribution parameters (`a_beta`, `b_beta`) to shape the hiding effectiveness.
- Experiment with different seeds (`rng()` commands) for reproducibility or variability.

## Outputs and Visualization üñºÔ∏è

- **3D Scatter Plots:** Display relationships between  $p^* $,  $q^*$, and  $R$ color-coded by $\mathsf{Adv}$.
- **Histograms:** Present distributions of $\mathsf{Adv}$ values, revealing underlying patterns in adversary-user dynamics.
- **Statistics:** Summaries for mean, min, and max values of $\mathsf{Adv}$ and $R$ printed directly to the command window.
